# Robo_Hangman
Robo Hangman is going to be the classic game, with a few important features:<br>
*1) Customizable guess limit.*<br>
    We always throw in fingers, toes, eyes, ears, hair, etc. to stretch out the game while playing it in person. Why not be able to do that here? <br>
*2) Word suggestion/spell-checker.*<br>
    Your word is going to be a little unfair to guess if you didn't even spell it correctly. A dictionary API will give us access to the proper way to word. Thanks, internet! <br>
*3) Spaces allowed.*<br>
    ...Maybe most hangman apps already do that, but I had one that didn't. And it was obnoxious. So I'll give the people what they want.

Coded in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Maybe PHP, too.
