# Robo_Hangman
Robo Hangman is going to be the classic game, with a few important features:
*1) Customizable guess limit.*
    We always throw in fingers, toes, eyes, ears, hair, etc. to stretch out the game while playing it in person. Why not be able to do that here?
*2) Word suggestion/spell-checker.*
    Your word is going to be a little unfair to guess if you didn't even spell it correctly. A dictionary API will give us access to the proper way to word. Thanks, internet!
*3) Spaces allowed.*
    ...Maybe most hangman apps already do that, but I had one that didn't. And it was obnoxious. So I'll give the people what they want.

Coded in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Maybe PHP, too.
